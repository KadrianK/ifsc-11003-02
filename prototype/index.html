  <h1>The G.O.A.T. debate in sports</h1>
<!-- This is completely made up and I will be spitballing random numbers and ideas --> 
</header>

<p>The greatest athelete of any sport has always been up for discussion. It was not until the late 2010s where people began to speak on who the G.O.A.T truly was. The G.O.A.T. is referred to as the greatest of all time. For women the term G.W.O.A.T. has been used to describe the greatestwoman of all time. </p>
<p>There are plenty of sports in which the G.O.A.T and G.W.O.A.T will be up for debate. The following will take a look at a few highly debated people. The topic is clearly opinion based with people throwing facts in the mix to strenghten their case. Nobody can be right or wrong in any case. The idea is kind of silly in terms of true importance. That does not mean it is not fun to discuss.The very opinionated Kadrian once said, <q> The goat debate in a team based sport is just wrong</q></p>
<section id="content" >
<h2>Basketball</h2>

<p>In the team game of basketball there has been 5 guys to be called the goat as of 2014. After that the list has grown to an unreasonable number with mosy experts trying to keep the narrative at 3-4 people. The people played in different eras and had fastly different skillsets. The idea of winning, teammate, championships, likability, and other factors come into play when discussing these guys. The idea ruins the game for a lot of guys, but it does show the knowledge and experience of a lot of people when having the discussion. The following list will show some of the lighly talked about guys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, John Stockton</li>
<li>Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson</li>
<li>LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kevin Durat</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett, Julius Erving, Giannis Antetokounmpo.</li>
<li>Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Shaq</li>
</ul>

<blockquote> The most common names that come up in the goat debate are Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant with Stephen Curry making waves in the conversation. Sadly guys who maintained dominance like Tim Duncan are never spoken about. </blockquote>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p>American football is a much different sport when discussing the G.O.A.T. The game is much more team based and the quarterback position is regarded as the most important positon however the years say that other positions can hold more weight in the G.O.A.T. debate. There are plenty of quarterbacks, wide receivers and running backs who can be held in the conversation. There will never be a correct answer for this topic and the communinity will always be divided since it is a preferance</p>

<p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h3>Campus living</h3>

<p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex<sup>21</sup> on the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.</p>

<h4>Athletics</h4>

<p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
<li>Women's Volleyball</li>
<li>Women's Soccer</li>
<li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
<li>Men's wrestling</li>
<blockquote>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</blockquote>
</ul>

Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.
