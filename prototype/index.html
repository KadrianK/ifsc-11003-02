  <h1>The G.O.A.T. debate in sports</h1>
<!-- This is completely made up and I will be spitballing random numbers and ideas --> 
</header>

<p>The greatest athelete of any sport has always been up for discussion. It was not until the late 2010s where people began to speak on who the G.O.A.T truly was. The G.O.A.T. is referred to as the greatest of all time. For women the term G.W.O.A.T. has been used to describe the greatestwoman of all time. </p>
<p>There are plenty of sports in which the G.O.A.T and G.W.O.A.T will be up for debate. The following will take a look at a few highly debated people. The topic is clearly opinion based with people throwing facts in the mix to strenghten their case. Nobody can be right or wrong in any case. The idea is kind of silly in terms of true importance. That does not mean it is not fun to discuss.The very opinionated Kadrian once said, <q> The goat debate in a team based sport is just wrong</q></p>
<div id="Basketball" >
  <!-- This is the basketball goat section-->
<h2>Basketball</h2>

<p>In the team game of basketball there has been 5 guys to be called the goat as of 2014. After that the list has grown to an unreasonable number with mosy experts trying to keep the narrative at 3-4 people. The people played in different eras and had fastly different skillsets. The idea of winning, teammate, championships, likability, and other factors come into play when discussing these guys. The idea ruins the game for a lot of guys, but it does show the knowledge and experience of a lot of people when having the discussion. The following list will show some of the lighly talked about guys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, John Stockton</li>
<li>Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson</li>
<li>LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kevin Durat</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett, Julius Erving, Giannis Antetokounmpo.</li>
<li>Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Shaq</li>
</ul>

<blockquote> The most common names that come up in the goat debate are Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant with Stephen Curry making waves in the conversation. Sadly guys who maintained dominance like Tim Duncan are never spoken about. </blockquote>

  <!-- This is the American Football goat section-->
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>American football is a much different sport when discussing the G.O.A.T. The game is much more team based and the quarterback position is regarded as the most important positon however the years say that other positions can hold more weight in the G.O.A.T. debate. There are plenty of quarterbacks, wide receivers and running backs who can be held in the conversation. There will never be a correct answer for this topic and the communinity will always be divided since it is a preferance</p>

<p>The American football has had its fair share of number of candidtes for the G.O.A.T conversations <strong> Tom Brady</strong> has been leading the conversation for many years at this point however that is not to say other names are not constantly thrown in the pot. The guys like 
Jerry rice, Ray Lewis, Jim Brown, Peyton Manning, and many others come to mind just to name a few. The debate is less about skill and more about impact and winning when it comes to this sport.</p>
<div id="Soccer" >
  <!-- This is the soccer goat section-->
<h3>Soccer</h3>

<p>The soccer sport is possibly the most popular sport in the world and I believe the G.O.A.T. debate is much more streamlined. The most popular players are in the conversation and rightfully so. The sport itself is simple but technically challenging. With a quick goolge seach the criteria is stated and even a few key players. The most common name I have heard over the years are Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo. I believe the experts and superfans will continue this debate for years to come. </p>
<ol>
<li>Lionel Messi</li>
<li>Pele</li>
<li>Diego Maradona</li>
<li>Christiano Ronaldo</li>

</dl>
<p>Combat sports are where I feel G.O.A.T. debates are more practical. Since these sports are <em> solo </em> competitive sports, this leads to a more direct comparisions. Things like weight classes and periods of competition will be the big divide. The 2 primary sports of boxing and UFC have strong fanbases with the G.O.A.T. debate chnaging names every few years. As competition becomes more exciting and the skills of the fighters grow, the gap between the brutal brawls of the past and the technical beatdowns of today are separating the fighters.
 Nowadays the fighters Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson take over the boxing conversation. There are fighter who are making waves and wanting that title like Terrance<q>Bud</q> Crawford, Gervonte <q>Tank</q> Davis, and Canelo Alveraz</p>
 <p>In the UFC the G.O.A.T. debate is much more recent since the sport itself is much younger. The names that come up are Jon Jones, Georges St-Pierre, Anderson Silva, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Demetrious Johnson. The sport is still young and the names will continue to change as the years go on. There is talks about who cheated and who was not cheating however the dominance of the fighters stated cannot be overlooked. Every fighter has right to the title.</p>
<div id="Women" >
  <!-- This is the women goat section-->
 <h5>G.W.O.A.T</h5>
<p>The G.W.O.A.T. debate is much more recent and not as widely discussed. That is not to say there are not some great atheletes who have made a strong case for the title. The most common names that come up are Serena Williams, Amanda Nunes, Ronda Rousey, Diana Taurasi, Mia Hamm, and Simone Biles. The list can go on for days as each one of these atheletes can be regarded as the best in their respective sports.</p>
