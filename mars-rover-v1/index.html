        <h2> History of Basketball </h2>
        <p> The Enduring History of Basketball: From Peach Baskets to Global Phenomenon
          The sport of basketball stands as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the universal appeal of competitive play. Born out of a simple need for an indoor winter activity, it rapidly evolved from a quaint gym diversion into one of the world's most dynamic and beloved professional sports. Its history is a fascinating journey of rule changes, cultural milestones, and the emergence of iconic global superstars.

          <h3> Magic and Bird Era </h3>
          <p>The NBA's true commercial and cultural explosion began in the 1980s, fueled by the intense rivalry between Earvin "Magic" Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers and Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics. These two superstars captivated audiences with their contrasting styles and charisma, pulling the league out of a period of low ratings and establishing it as a major entertainment force. A crucial technical change in 1979—the introduction of the three-point line—began its slow, steady transformation of offensive strategy.</p>

          <h3> Jordan Era </h3>
          <p>The 1990s belonged to Michael Jordan. Playing for the Chicago Bulls, Jordan's unmatched combination of athletic prowess, competitive drive, and global marketing appeal turned the NBA into a worldwide brand. His six championships with the Bulls made him a cultural icon and inspired a new generation of players and fans across every continent.</p>

          <h3> Modern Era </h3>
          <p>The 21st century has been marked by two major trends: continued globalization and the embrace of the three-point shot. International Influence: Players like Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), Manu Ginóbili (Argentina), Tony Parker (France), and Yao Ming (China) demonstrated that basketball talent was everywhere, leading to a massive increase in the number of international players in the NBA. This global reach was further solidified by the legendary "Dream Team"—the first Olympic team composed of active NBA players—which dominated the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p>
          <p>Small Ball and the Three-Pointer: The modern game has been completely reshaped by the three-point line. Teams like the Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, popularized an offense focused on high-volume three-point shooting and "small-ball" lineups, creating a more spaced and higher-scoring game than ever before. This era emphasizes versatility, shooting range, and pace, moving the game far beyond the post-focused strategies of the early days.
